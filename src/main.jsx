// ========== ROUTING CONFIGURATION - ADVANCED SPA ARCHITECTURE ==========

/**
 * BROWSER ROUTER CONFIGURATION
 * 
 * Modern React Router v6+ implementation demonstrating:
 * 
 * ROUTING BEST PRACTICES:
 * ======================
 * 
 * 1. SEO-OPTIMIZED URL STRUCTURE:
 *    - Clean, descriptive URLs without hash routing
 *    - Hierarchical organization (products/category structure)
 *    - Parameter-based dynamic routing for scalability
 *    - Search-engine friendly URL patterns
 * 
 * 2. USER EXPERIENCE ROUTING:
 *    - Logical navigation flow matching user mental models
 *    - Breadcrumb-friendly hierarchical structure
 *    - Bookmarkable URLs for direct access to content
 *    - Error handling through catch-all route
 * 
 * 3. E-COMMERCE ROUTING PATTERNS:
 *    - Product catalog organization
 *    - Shopping flow progression (browse → product → checkout)
 *    - User preference areas (favorites)
 *    - Search and discovery functionality
 * 
 * 4. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
 *    - createBrowserRouter for modern React Router patterns
 *    - Dynamic parameter extraction (:slug, :categoryName)
 *    - Explicit component imports for code splitting readiness
 *    - Catch-all route (*) for comprehensive error handling

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  // ========== HOME PAGE - LANDING & CONVERSION ==========
  {
    path: '/', 
    element: <App />,
    // Primary landing page showcasing portfolio concept and driving engagement
  },
  
  // ========== PORTFOLIO & PERSONAL BRANDING PAGES ==========
  {
    path: '/about',
    element: <About />,
    // Career transition story, technical skills, and professional positioning
  },
  {
    path: '/contact',
    element: <Contact />,
    // Professional communication hub with dual email system
  },
  
  // ========== E-COMMERCE PRODUCT CATALOG ==========
  {
    path: '/products',
    element: <ProductPage />,
    // Advanced product catalog with filtering, search, and sorting
  },
  {
    path: '/products/:slug',
    element: <ProductDetail />,
    // Dynamic product detail pages with SEO-friendly slug routing
    // Enables URLs like: /products/nintendo-switch-2, /products/packers-jersey
  },
  
  // ========== CATEGORY-BASED NAVIGATION ==========
  {
    path: '/category/:categoryName',
    element: <Category />,
    // Category-specific product views (Technology, Apparel, Misc)
    // Enables URLs like: /category/technology, /category/apparel
  },
  
  // ========== USER PREFERENCE & SHOPPING FLOW ==========
  {
    path: '/favorites',
    element: <Favorites />,
    // Wishlist functionality demonstrating persistent user preferences
  },
  {
    path: '/checkout', 
    element: <Checkout />,
    // Multi-step checkout process with form validation and email integration
  },
  
  // ========== SEARCH & DISCOVERY ==========
  {
    path: '/search',
    element: <SearchResults />,
    // Search results page with query parameter handling
  },
  
  // ========== ERROR HANDLING ==========
  {
    path: '*', 
    element: <NotFound />,
    // Catch-all route for 404 errors and graceful failure handling
    // Must be last in route array to function as fallback
  }
]);

// ========== CONTEXT PROVIDER COMPOSITION - GLOBAL STATE ARCHITECTURE ==========

/**
 * PROVIDER COMPOSITION STRATEGY
 * 
 * Strategic ordering and nesting of Context providers demonstrates:
 * 
 * CONTEXT API BEST PRACTICES:
 * ===========================
 * 
 * 1. PROVIDER HIERARCHY & DEPENDENCIES:
 *    - CartProvider (outermost): Core e-commerce functionality
 *    - CheckoutProvider: Depends on cart data, handles transaction flow
 *    - FavoritesProvider: Independent user preferences
 *    - RouterProvider: React Router context for navigation
 * 
 * 2. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
 *    - Targeted context usage prevents unnecessary re-renders
 *    - Separation of concerns across different state domains
 *    - Strategic provider placement for efficient data flow
 * 
 * 3. SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS:
 *    - Clear dependency relationships for future expansion
 *    - Modular context design supports feature additions
 *    - Provider composition pattern enables complex state management
 * 
 * BUSINESS LOGIC SEPARATION:
 * =========================
 * 
 * 1. CART CONTEXT:
 *    - Product management, quantity tracking, price calculations
 *    - Persistent storage for user session management
 *    - Global cart state accessible across all components
 * 
 * 2. CHECKOUT CONTEXT:
 *    - Transaction flow management and form state
 *    - Order processing and confirmation workflows
 *    - Integration with email systems for order communication
 * 
 * 3. FAVORITES CONTEXT:
 *    - User preference tracking and wishlist management
 *    - Independent of shopping cart for different use cases
 *    - Persistent favorites across browser sessions
